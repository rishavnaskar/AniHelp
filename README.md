# ANIHELP
## A pet away from home


AniHelp is a portal for all the animal lovers across the world. There are many innocent helpless animals out there who craving for the love. At the same time, there are many people who want to have pets but don't get enough time or place to care for a pet. We have finally come to their help. It's time for uniting these lost pet lovers and pets across the world!

Once an user petifies an animal, they can witness the NGOs taking care of their chosen pet, feeding them, making them feel at home and so on, all through our app. Weekly updates of photos and videos of their virtual pets are shared by the concerned NGOs through our app & website in real-time.

We often see poor animals, be it infants or adults, suffering on the streets, hiding in some basement or restlessly searching for food. To bring everyone's attention to these creatures, we have introduced a Posts Section where users can share such stories which will reach all other users and NGOs so that someone can conveniently tend to help them.
